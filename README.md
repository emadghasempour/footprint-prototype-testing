# Footprint Prototype Testing

## Idea

The goal of Footprint project is to make information from different sources, **Organized** and **More** **accessible** through linking the informations to eachother to be there when we need them.

## Problem

Losing a note in the long list of other notes, or forgetting about a bookmarked page in the pile of our other bookmarks after two weeks are not unfamiliar stories.  with this issue some valuable information will simply be lost and forgotten after some time, in a way that it wasn't exist.

## Solution

**Footprints offers a solution for the problem above by making informations related**. this way you can find that piece of information by reaching to any of its relations too.  Or by doing a search about something you can have access to all the related items as well, that might get related month ago and even if you already forgot it. 

it will work like a thread that you start from one end and follow the way and reach to another end of the thread. 

Footprint basincally: 

 1. Unify diffent sources of information in one place (Notes, Bookmarked pages, Voices and etc) Using mobile app, browser extension and etc.
 2. Makes it easier to make informations related to eachother.

This way information stay active and accesable for longer time.

## How to use
1- Create or import information into Footprint app

**Note**: to import information from other apps  you can share them (Text for now) with Footprint app.

<table>
  <tr>
    <td><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5299974/206841347-fdd94ae8-5648-4907-96cc-eb1d6e1a94f8.jpg?raw=true" alt="Dash light" width="220"/></td>
  </tr>
</table>

2- After Creating the card and saving them, you can select them from the list of cards and make them related to other cards using the attachment icon on top right corner of the screen.

<table>
  <tr>
    <td><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5299974/206841500-f1f1fbd3-614a-437d-b29c-1b36be623d94.jpg?raw=true" alt="Dash light" width="220"/></td>
  </tr>
</table>

you can also unlink a related card by long pressing on the related card.

<table>
  <tr>
    <td><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5299974/206850606-79020239-5904-4535-af60-90f98e5e7980.jpg?raw=true" alt="Dash light" width="220"/></td>
  </tr>
</table>

This is the first prototype of footprint app to see if the idea resolve the mentioned of losing track of informations and how it can be improved to offer a better solution . 

Thank you for your time to test the app and honest feedback in advance. Feel free to be cruel (but not too muchðŸ˜„)
