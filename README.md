# Footprint Prototype Testing

## Idea

The goal of Footprint project is to make information from different sources, **Organized** and **More** **accessible** through linking the informations to eachother to be there when we need them.

## Problem

Losing a note in the long list of other notes, or forgetting about a bookmarked page in the pile of our other bookmarks after two weeks are not unfamiliar stories. 

## Solution

Footprints offers a solution to the problem above by making informations related. this way you can find that piece of information by reaching to any of its relations too.  or by doing a search about something you can have access to all the related items too, that might get related month ago and forgotten from the surface. 

Footprint basincally: 

 1. Unify diffent sources of information in one place (Notes, Bookmarked pages, Voices and etc) Using mobile app and browser extension.
 2. Makes it easier to make informations related to eachother.

This way information stay active and accesable for longer time.

## how to use
1- Create or import information into Footprint app

**Note**: to import information from other apps  you can share them (Text for now) with Footprint app.

<table>
  <tr>
    <td><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5299974/206841347-fdd94ae8-5648-4907-96cc-eb1d6e1a94f8.jpg?raw=true" alt="Dash light" width="220"/></td>
  </tr>
</table>

2- After Creating the card you can relate them to other cards using the attachment icon on top right corner of the screen. you can also unlink a related card by long pressing on the card.

<table>
  <tr>
    <td><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5299974/206841500-f1f1fbd3-614a-437d-b29c-1b36be623d94.jpg?raw=true" alt="Dash light" width="220"/></td>
  </tr>
</table>

This is the first prototype of footprint app to see if the idea resolve the mentioned of losing track of informations and how it can be improved to offer a better solution . 

Thank you for your time to test the app and honest feedback in advance. Feel free to be cruel (but not too muchðŸ˜„)
